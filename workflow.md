#### NMAP
Aggressive NMAPing
- TCP Scan
  - nmap -sC -sV -sT -n -T5 -p- -vv (IP Address) | tee -a nmap_output
- UDP Scan
  - nmap -sU (IP) | tee -a nmap_udp_output

#### Considerations
Recon every open port with full exhaustion, don't hold back on the recon as it will uncover new components of the target

#### Web recon
Gobuster dir -w (wordlist) -u (target link) - This is how a directory brute force is done

Gobuster vhost () - Virtual host scan to ensure that any subdomains can be uncovered.
